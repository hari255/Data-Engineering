# "Data Automation (ELT)"


## 1. ELT Script:
Created a powerful ELT script that smoothly moves data from one PostgreSQL database to another.

# 2. Airflow DAG: 
_Apache Airflow is an open-source platform designed to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows._

| Operations | Description |
| ------:| -----------:|
| run_elt_script Task| Runs the ELT script, ensuring data flows seamlessly. |
|dbt_run Task |  Uses dbt in a container for modeling and analysis. Turns raw data into useful insights. |


# 3. dbt Project Configuration:
In the background, the dbt project (custom_postgres) is carefully set up in dbt_project.yml. It tells dbt where to find models, analyses, tests, etc. Also, it defines how the example model should appear‚Äîlike shaping raw data into a neat table. üìä

This project is my way of making data tasks simpler and more automated. ü§ñ Excited about the potential impact! Stay tuned for more updates. üë®‚Äçüíª #DataAutomation #DataEngineering #dbt #Airflow #TechJourney 

# 4. Docker

**The docker-comppose.yaml file sets up an environment for an ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) pipeline using PostgreSQL databases and Apache Airflow for workflow orchestration**

## 1. Services

### source_postgres:

 + Runs a PostgreSQL container as the source database.
 + Initializes the database with an SQL script.

### destination_postgres:

 + Runs a PostgreSQL container as the destination database.

### postgres:
